# Codebase

Welcome to **Codebase**! This repository is a collection of reusable pieces of code across all the programming languages I work with. It serves as a central hub where I can easily access, reuse, and improve code snippets, utilities, and modules. Additionally, there is a dedicated **Playground** folder for experimenting with new ideas, testing concepts, and exploring new techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

### 1. **Languages**

Each supported language has its own directory. Inside each directory, you'll find various reusable pieces of code, such as:

- **Utilities:** Common helper functions or utilities.
- **Modules:** Self-contained modules or libraries.
- **Examples:** Sample code demonstrating specific techniques or patterns.

### 2. **Playground**

The **Playground** folder is where I experiment with new ideas across all languages. This area is for trying out new algorithms, testing concepts, and prototyping without worrying about breaking anything.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for personal use, but feel free to explore the code and use any of it in your own projects. If you have suggestions or improvements, I'm happy to review pull requests or discuss ideas in the issues section.
